This is currently flagged as trojan for some reason.
This project is on hold to see what I can do in the future as this is NOT malicious what so ever....

Any ideas?

Update:
The way this application is supposed to work, I believe it is impossible to use it unless I pay for a certificate on a yearly subscription.
It does a lot of things a standard malware or virus would - Download, unpack, delete, move/start another executable. 
For those interested, the source is here. Check it out and use it if you want.

However, I have tried making a local certificate. I do not know how well it will work.
